# BlackJack-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the popular card game BlackJack. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows players to place bets, draw cards, and try to get as close to 21 without going over.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the game interface.
CSS: Styling for an engaging UI with custom buttons and a themed background.
JavaScript: Game logic, including card drawing, betting system, and status updates.
How to Play:
Click "START GAME" to begin.
Place a bet using one of the betting buttons.
Draw cards by clicking "NEW CARD" and try to reach a sum of 21 without exceeding it.
The game will inform you if you win (BlackJack), lose, or can continue drawing.
